This mod is Vanilla Compatible by default.\
All changes except Devotion Inventory are Server-Sided. 

The mod will only include Enigma & Soul changes, if the modpack contains other Content mods or if it's enabled in the settings.\
As these changes can only be used with players who also have the mod.
 
This way, people can still use this mod as a vanilla compatible Server-Side Devotion / Dissonance / Vengence bug fix and tweaks mod.


Settings can be changed ingame via RiskOfOptions.

## Devotion


Devotion is probably the biggest Artifact, so it has the most flaws, code wise and in gameplay.\
Many small bug fixes make it, just work better.

AI can't recognize hazards so they shouldn't be able to die to fall damage, lava & void fog.\
Teleporting more often to avoid getting stuck but also to make them more around you.

Giving them Void items can be interesting.\
Not going to blacklist Shipping Request.

##

Vengence is weird to balance as depending on the character the fight would always just be a nightmare.\
Not a big fan of trying to avoid certain fun item just because of the Umbra.\
SotV made it so they can get AIBlacklisted and uninheritable items which is not great. 

##
Enigma no longer having Fragments, like how it does in RoR1, is a missed oppurtunity for sure.

I tried having only 1 Enigma equipment like in RoR1, but seeing what Equipment you have is a lot better.

##
Soul in vanilla is super lame, so the addition of greater wisps should help, make it more.\
For all I care it makes the Simulacrum Augment more interesting.\
