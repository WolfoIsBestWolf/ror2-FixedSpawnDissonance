This mod is required by everyone.

If you wish to use this mod as a Host with players who do not have it. You can disable content added by this mod.\
This would include Enigma Fragments and Greater Soul Wisps. \
Rest of the changes is probably fine.

## Artifact of Dissonance
Adds Hermit Crabs and Sots enemies to Dissonance as they are missing from it.

The Artifact spams less minibosses and have more evenly distributed categories.

For enemies with multiple skins such as Titans or Vermin, a different skin will be chosen at the start of every stage.

When using Dissonance all enemies on Commencement/Simumencement can be Perfected Elites. 


## Artifact of Enigma
Most equipment drops will be replaced by a Enigma Fragment that reduces Equipment Cooldown by 12%.

Enigma can no longer give Spinel Tonic, Recycler, Tricorn and can now give Milky Chrysalis, Effigy of Grief.

## Artifact of Vengence
Umbras get Adaptive Armor but less health.\
They won't get items such as Elixir and Tougher Times.

Umbras use equipment when attacking while generally being in mid to close range and also sprint more often.\
Umbras will not get items that are AIBlacklisted.
Umbras will only get a limited amount of certain items. (ie not too many hoofs)

They'll on drop items of higher tiers. (Green, Red, Yellow)\
Umbras will be able to drop items they're not normally able to drop. (Captain Microbots, Dios)

You will encounter a random Umbra instead one for the character you're playing as when using Metamorphosis.

## Artifact of Evolution & Tag Changes
Artifact of Evolution will now give a stack of 3 Whites or 2 Greens after looping so enemies can keep up for longer.

The Void team will now inherit items too and any item that has a Void version will be transformed into that.

Evolution can no longer give:\
Nkuhanas Opinion, Spare Drone Parts, Tesla Coil, Aegis, Hunters Harpoon, Regenerative Scrap.\
Brittle Crown, Gesture of the Drowned, Beads of Fealty, Egocentrism, Focused Convergence, Defiant Gauge.

This should reduce the amount of unfairly overpowered items items enemies can get while also preventing some useless ones.



## Artifact of Kin & Yellow Drops for enemies
Artifact of Kin will try to always have a different enemy than the last stage.

Hordes of Many will now drop fitting Yellow Items depending on the enemy.\
This should help with Artifact of Kin or just general situations where the game fails to spawn a Boss.\
You cannot use Tricorn on enemies for these drops.

Forces Minions and Drones to be random elite.

## Artifact of Soul
Larger enemies spawn Greater Soul Wisps.\
Bosses spawn Arch Soul Wisps.

Soul Wisps inherit items/elite status.\
Soul Wisps reward some money.\
Soul Wisps slow on hit.

Soul Wisps had their stats adjusted to last longer but have less damage.\
They die on a timer now instead of due to negative health regen.

Overall this should make the Artifact more noticeable but still often just free on kill effects.

## Artifact of Sacrifice
Void enemies now drops Void items.\
Bosses now drop Green/Red/Yellows only but regular enemies drop slightly less Greens.\
Stages will have more enemies at the start.

## Artifact of Spite
Bombs will hurt and knock enemies around.\
Smaller enemies drop more bombs and in a larger radius.\

Damage is now always the same regardless of what enemy dropped it. (Done via someone elses mod)\
Damage scales a extra amount per stage in addition to ambient level.

## Artifact of Devotion

Adds the DLC2 elites to the rotation because they forgot to add them.

Makes the oldest lemurians inventory viewable in the scoreboard for every player that has one.

#

Artifact of Command allows choice of Elite Aspect. Command cubes will auto complete if it would be only 1 option.

Artifact of Swarms now works on more ally items such as Goobo Jr, Spare Drone Parts and ups every team limit by 50%.
