## Notes
If you wish to use this mod as a Host with players who do not have it. You can disable content added by this mod.\
This would include Enigma Fragments and Greater Soul Wisps.\
Rest of the changes is probably fine.
##
Vengence is weird to balance as depending on the character the fight would always just be a nightmare.\
SotV making it so they no longer respect AIBlacklist is also just ???.
##
Soul in vanilla is super lame, so the addition of greater wisps should help.\
Should still allow for doubling on kill effects but less often now.

##
Enigma not carrying over Enigma Fragments is just sad.\
But having normal equipment instead of one "Enigma" equipment feels better so not porting that part.

Devoted Lemurians could benefit quite a lot from Void items.\
Not going to blacklist Shipping Request.
