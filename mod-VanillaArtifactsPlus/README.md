This mod is Vanilla Compatible by default.\
All changes except Devotion Inventory are Server-Sided. 

The mod will only include Enigma & Soul changes, if the modpack contains other Content mods or if it's enabled in the settings.\
As these changes can only be used with players who also have the mod.
 
This way, people can still use this mod as a vanilla compatible Server-Side Devotion / Dissonance / Vengence bug fix and tweaks mod.


Settings can be changed ingame via RiskOfOptions.

## Devotion


AI can't recognize hazards so they shouldn't be able to die to fall damage, lava & void fog.\
Teleporting more often to avoid getting stuck but also to make them more around you.

Giving them Void items is quite a lot of fun.


##

Vengence is weird to balance as depending on the character the fight would always just be a nightmare.\
Not a big fan of trying to avoid certain fun item just because of the Umbra.\
SotV made it so they can get AIBlacklisted and uninheritable items which is not great. 

##
Enigma no longer having Fragments, like how it does in RoR1, is a missed oppurtunity for sure.

##
Soul in vanilla is a very nothing Artifact.\
The addition of Greater and Lunar Souls Wisps should help make it feel more present and chaotic.

Souls dropping money makes waiting or killing them a bit more of a choice.\
Inheriting elite type can double OnDeath effects of the enemy which is cool.

Makes the Simulacrum Augment more interesting.
